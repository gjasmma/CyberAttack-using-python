# 🛡️ Network Security Dashboard

A lightweight, interactive platform for simulating firewall behavior, scanning ports, and monitoring network security. Built to help developers and security enthusiasts understand and test basic network protection mechanisms.

## 🔧 Features

- **🔍 Port Scanner**  
  Scan specific ports (e.g., port 22) to check their status and responsiveness.

- **🧰 Firewall Patch**  
  Apply simulated firewall patches to enhance protection and test rule updates.

- **📋 Firewall Status**  
  Retrieve current firewall configuration and status reports.

- **📊 Port Scan Chart**  
  Visualize port scan results in an intuitive chart format.

## 🚀 Getting Started
